            <h2>Stress Level Detection</h2>
            <p>For stress level detection in the MentoBliss application, we employ 
                a sophisticated algorithm that utilizes machine learning and psychological research. 
                The Android-based system prompts users with a series of carefully crafted questions designed to assess 
                various aspects of their emotional state. The answers are then processed through a proprietary stress
                 prediction model, 
                taking into account factors such as response time, sentiment analysis, and pattern recognition. 
                The model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure accurate and personalized results. Additionally, 
                real-time user feedback is incorporated to continually refine and enhance the algorithm's effectiveness. 
                The stress level detection feature provides users with valuable insights into their emotional well-being, 
                fostering a proactive approach to mental health management.</p>

            <h2>Mood-Boosting Activities</h2>
            <p>In the realm of mood-boosting activities within MentoBliss, our Android
                 application employs an intuitive recommendation engine backed by psychological principles and
                  user preferences. After assessing the user's stress level, the system dynamically generates personalized 
                  suggestions for activities proven to enhance mood and reduce stress. These activities span a spectrum of options, 
                  including mindfulness exercises, physical activities, creative pursuits, and social engagements. The recommendation 
                  engine leverages machine learning algorithms to adapt and refine suggestions based on user feedback and engagement patterns.
                   This approach ensures that users receive tailored and effective mood-boosting activities, promoting a positive mental state 
                   and overall well-being. The seamless integration of these personalized activities aims to empower users with practical 
                strategies for improving their mood and managing stress effectively.</p>

        <div class="service">
            <h2>Virtual One-on-One Interaction</h2>
            <p>Facilitating virtual one-on-one interactions with mental health professionals is a pivotal component of the MentoBliss application, creating a supportive environment for users to address their mental health needs. Leveraging Android technology, the app provides a secure and user-friendly platform for users to connect with qualified psychiatrists in real-time.

                The virtual interaction feature incorporates end-to-end encryption to 
                ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user conversations. Through the app, 
                users can schedule and participate in private sessions with mental health professionals, 
                fostering a safe space for open dialogue and personalized support.
                
                The Android-based virtual interaction system integrates seamlessly with 
                the overall MentoBliss framework, enabling users to transition from stress level assessment to 
                tailored mood-boosting activities and, when necessary, to direct one-on-one consultations with mental health experts.
                 This comprehensive approach aligns with our commitment to promoting mental well-being by combining 
                innovative technology with compassionate and expert-driven support.</p>
