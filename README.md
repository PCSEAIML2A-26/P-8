<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
   1. Programming Language: Kotlin or Java
•	Kotlin is designed to be a more modern and concise programming language compared to Java. It reduces boilerplate code and provides features that enhance developer productivity.
•	Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can seamlessly use Kotlin and Java code within the same project. This is beneficial for projects where there is existing Java code that you want to integrate with or migrate gradually.
•	Java has been the traditional language for Android development for many years. While it might be considered more verbose than Kotlin, it remains a robust and widely used language.
•	Java has a mature ecosystem with a vast number of libraries and tools available for Android development.
2. Development Environment: Android Studio
•	Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. It's provided by Google and is tailored specifically for building Android applications.
•	Android Studio offers a rich set of features, including a visual layout editor, code editing tools, debugging features, and support for various Android SDKs and emulators.
•	Android Studio uses the Gradle build system, allowing for flexible and customizable build configurations.
3. UI Development: XML Layouts
•	In Android development, the user interface (UI) is defined using XML (extensible Markup Language) layouts. This approach allows developers to describe the UI components and their arrangement in a declarative manner.
•	Android Studio provides a visual layout editor that allows developers to design their app's UI using a drag-and-drop interface. Developers can switch between XML code and the visual editor to make design adjustments.
4. Firebase Authentication:
•	Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication is a service provided by Google's Firebase platform that simplifies the process of authenticating users in mobile and web applications.
Key Features:
1.	Various Sign-In Methods:
